## Contents

* `listings`: Scripts that implement simulations.
              These resemble the listings in the paper, except that the
              paper listings are "illustrative fragments" (cf [Kernighan and Ritchie 1970](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language)), not meant to be
              complete in every detail. The scripts in `listings` should run. Let us know if they don't.

* `figures`: These scripts are used to generate the figures / visualizations in the paper.

* `sandbox`: For playing around.
